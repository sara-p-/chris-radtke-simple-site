# Chris Radtke Simple Site

This is a temporary site built for Chris Radtke while we work on her actual site build. She needed some sort of portfolio site to be published before a grant deadline, so I'm making this simple child theme dependent on the TwentyTwentyFive Parent Theme.

Date: 2/17/2026

## Note:

The name of the theme/project root should be 'twentytwentyfive-child' in order to work with the parent theme.
